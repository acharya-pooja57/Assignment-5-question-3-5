To find the relationship between different organisms and see if the organisms have any mutation over time and has evloved from a known organisms so that it is easier to distinguish its characteristics. For example, with the variation in covid 19 virus we can use the phylogenetic tree and see the similarity betweeen various viruus and its existing variant itself. This will allow to have some predictions and ruun different test to get desired outcome and find the treatemnet faster and save lives of people. To people who are studying about evolutionaryy trend also, phyloogenetics and phylogenetic tree might help a lot and with coding and all these sofftware it is easier to get the results faster.
